"""Module for similarity judgment trials.

Classes:
    SimilarityTrials: Abstract class for similarity judgment trials.

Functions:

Notes:
    A `stimulus_id` of `-1` is a reserved value to be used as a
        placeholder.
    Groups are used to identify distinct populations of agents. For
        example, similarity judgments could be collected from two
        groups: novices and experts. During inference, group
        information can be used to infer a separate set of attention
        weights for each group while sharing all other parameters.

TODO:
    * Add SortDocket class
    * Add SortObservations class
    * Add Observations "interface" which requires `as_dataset()` method
        which returns a tf.data.Dataset object, agent_id, group_id, and
        session_id.
    * MAYBE restructure group_id and agent_id. If we wanted to allow
    for arbitrary hierarchical models, maybe better off making
    group_id a 2D array of shape=(n_trial, n_group_level)

    """Abstract base class for similarity judgment trials.

    This abstract base class is used to organize data associated with
    similarity judgment trials. As the class name suggests, this object
    handles data associated with multiple trials. Depending on the
    concrete subclass, the similarity trials represent to-be-shown
    trials (i.e., a docket) or judged trials (i.e., observations).

    Attributes:
        n_trial: An integer indicating the number of trials.
        stimulus_set: An integer matrix containing indices that
            indicate the set of stimuli used in each trial. Each row
            indicates the stimuli used in one trial.
        config_idx: An integer array indicating the
            configuration of each trial. The integer is an index
            referencing the row of config_list and the element of
            outcome_idx_list.
            shape = (n_trial,)
        config_list: A DataFrame object describing the unique trial
            configurations.
        outcome_idx_list: A list of 2D arrays indicating all possible
            outcomes for a trial configuration. Each element in the
            list corresponds to a trial configuration in config_list.
            Each row of the 2D array indicates one potential outcome.

    Methods:
        subset: Return a subset of similarity trials given an index.
        save: Save the object to disk.
        is_present: Indicate if a stimulus is present.
