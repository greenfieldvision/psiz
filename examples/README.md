# PsiZ Examples

The examples are organized into separate directories based on trial type.
* `rank`
* `rate`

Where appropriate, part of the filename indicates the type of inference performed.
* `mle` indicates maximum liklihood inference which yields a point estimate model.
* `vi` indicates variationa inference which yields a posterior probability model.
