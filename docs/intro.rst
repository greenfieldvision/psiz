What's in a name?
=================

The name PsiZ (pronounced like the word *size*, /sʌɪz/) is meant to serve as
shorthand for the term *psychological embedding*. The greek letter Psi is
often used to represent the field of psychology and the matrix variable **Z**
is often used in machine learning to denote a latent feature space.


Purpose
=======

PsiZ provides the computational tools to infer a continuous, multivariate
stimulus representation using similarity relations. It integrates cognitive
theory with contemporary computational methods.


Examples
