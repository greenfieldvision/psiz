Pretrained Models
#################

A select number of pretrained models can be obtained PsiZ's
`OSF repository <https://osf.io/7f96y/>`_.

Models are stored as directories using TensorFlow's SavedModel format.

Model directories are named using the format:
:code:`emb-<arch_id>-<input_id>-<n_dim>-<split>`. For example,
:code:`emb-0-195-4-0` would indicate a model using :code:`arch_id=0`,
:code:`input_id=195`, :code:`n_dim=4`, and :code:`split=0`.


ImageNet Validation Set
=======================

ImageNet validation set models are stored at :code:`val/models/psiz0.5.0_tf2.4.xâ€‹`.
These models were created using an active learning procedure that
intelligently selects which trials to ask human participants. Data collection
occured across multiple rounds involving model inference, trial selection, and
judgment collection. In each round, three models were inferred to create an
ensemble model.

Models for two rounds are currently hosted on OSF.

- Round 118 (v0.1): This includes observations for 1,000 stimuli subset of the
  ImageNet validation set. There is one stimulus for each class.
- Round 195 (v0.2): This includes observations for 50,000 stimuli.

.. note::
    Data collection is ongoing. A final round (v1.0) will be added in the near
    future.

.. note::
    Please see this `ArXiv paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11015>`_ for
    additional details regarding the ImageNet validation models.


Loading a Pretrained Model
--------------------------

After downloading the desired model from OSF
(e.g., :code:`val/models/psiz0.5.0_tf2.4.x/emb-0-195-4-0`), load the model in the
following way:

.. code-block:: python

    import tensorflow as tf

    fp_model = 'local/path/to/emb-0-195-4-0`
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model(fp_model)


Stimuli Point Estimates
-----------------------

One often wants point estimates for the stimuli. After loading the model, you
can obtain the posterior modes in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get the posterior modes of the embedding.
    z_mode = model.stimuli.embeddings.mode()  # shape=(50001, 4)
    # The embedding layer uses mask_zero=True, so the first embedding
    # coordinate is a meaningless placeholder.
    z_mode = z_mode[1:]  # shape=(50000, 4)


Mapping Embedding Indices to Files
----------------------------------

The mapping of embedding indices to files is determined by the ImageNet
validation :code:`catalog.hdf5` object (https://osf.io/bf3e2/). This object
uses the standard ImageNet class and file names, but does **not** use the
standard ordering.

After downloading the :code:`catalog.hdf5` file, you can load it in the
following way:

.. code-block:: python

    catalog = psiz.catalog.load_catalog('local/path/to/catalog.hdf5')
    filepaths = catalog.filepath()

    # If you want filepaths thar are fully resolved to your local copy
    # of the ImageNet validation set, set the `common_path` attribute.
    catalog.common_path = 'local/path/to/imagenet/val/`
    filepaths = catalog.filepath()

The order stimuli in :code:`filepaths` corresponds to the order of the stimuli
in the embedding layer.
